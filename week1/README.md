# Message from the coordiator
this week we learn about Javascript conditionals, loops, variable assignment and functions. We learnt how to think about logic, problems and how functions make code DRY (don't repeat yourself). 
We also installed linux and went through the hard battles of reformating our PC's, some working on it for hours and even days. 
We learnt about how functions can call other functions. Functions are just boxes. They have inputs and outputs. Inside functions, they can perform any kind of operations.

Finally we finished with learning the basics of HTML and CSS. We learnt how to modify and create a basic site.
