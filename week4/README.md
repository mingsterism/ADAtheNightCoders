## Self Reflection 
Karmun
1) Javascript Algorithm and Problem solving: 2/10
2) Thoughts
3) Challenges   
   1) Have the tools ready, just not the clear understanding and path
      1) Knowing all the syntax, but when using the syntax, not sure how to apply it

Charles 
1) Javascript Algorithm and Problem solving: 4/10
2) Thoughts 
   1) Since putting more practice to Javascript, it has made me more creative and want to try to do unique things
   2) When you try to go deeper into javacsript, you find yourself getting active and somewhat lost in the midst of all the excitement and knowledge bombardment that JS offers
3) Challenges
   1) Due to other activities, hardly have enough time to solve challenges and practice JS

      2) Create an application 
   2) Problem solving
      1) Hard when not familiar with the methods and the way things are done

## Databases
**The database we are using: MongoDB**
- **what is a database**: A place to store information for applications
- **what type of database is mongodb**
  - Document database
  - non-relational database
**what does a document database contain**
- Collection (eg: Students)
  - Documents {object} (eg: Melissa)
  - Documents are structured as objects.
  {
      name: "John", 
      age: 10, 
      address: "Malaysia",
      friends: [
          { name: "Luke", age: 20 },
          { name: "Luke", age: 20 }
      ], 
      hobbies: [
          { type: "SPORT", skill: 50 },
          { type: "SPORT", skill: 50 },
          { type: "SPORT", skill: 50 }
      ]
  }

  **5 Types of databases (oldest to newest)**
  relational (Structured Query Language)
  1) Table Row
  non relational (NoSQL) (No Structured Query Language)
  1) Document 
  2) Key Value
  3) Columnar 
  4) Graph

## Insight
1) You do not need to learn all the databases. You only need to know 1 to start building an application.
2) The only one you should learn is either Document or Table Row Database
  1) They are the most versatible (they can store most types of information out there)
  2) Document and Table Row based have the most support and are one of the oldest databases out there.
3) There are **databases as a service**
  3) Companies out there already setup the entire database for you. You do not have to manage them anymore, nor do you need the indepth knowledge required to setup your own database.
  4) Always use the services already existing out there. 
     1) Unless your startup goes big and needs to scale. Then the cost of the service really skyrockets. The savings you make from hiring your own developers and building on your own, outweigh the cost of your service. 



## What we did this week

2) Build a mini application in Vuejs
   1) Todo App
      1) Understand the logic of add, deleting and appending to arrays.
      2) Learnt html, css whilst building the logic of creating a todo app with basic features
