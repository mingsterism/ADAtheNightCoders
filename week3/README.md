# Self Reflection
* Karmun (NPM)
  * Shows how other people are creating things using javascript. 
  * In a way if doing coding, there are many ways to achieve one thing. 
  * See how other people are doing things.

* Charles
  * Javascript best programming language
  * Widely used 
  * NPM is node package manager. 

* Pung
  * Coding is a continous improvement
  * NPM packages are other people's code that others can see and view the soruce code. 
  * Can see other better ways to solve a particular problem
  * Copying other people's work is a good thing as you can learn off each other (contratry to traditional schooling)

* Weining
  * Understanding the logic of javascript is not easy but critical
  * You can use any package for your own purpose

* Weevian
  * Javascript most challenging part - to understand the logic and to read like a machine. 
  * Practice is important 
  * Most coders are using the fundamentals, but they have creative ways to put code together to do great thing. 
    * The way they solve the problem is innovative. It's the how of solving, not the act of solving itself. 

* Melissa
  * A whole new world
  * The most I learnt javascript, the less i know. 
    * I dont know what i dont know
  * Have to be detailed. It's a very specific language. cannot miss even a fullstop or a curly brace
  * Before writing code, need to know what you want. Plan out your code before actually doing the work. 
  * NPM is a package manager. allows people to contribute to other's people packages
  * Allows other people to use your work

* Erin
  * Can learn from other's people code
  * Javascript similar to other langauges due to the logical thinking that is required regardless of the language
  * Every language must be patient and determined to solve the problem
  * Understanding what code you are writing
