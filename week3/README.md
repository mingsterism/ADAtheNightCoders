# Self Reflection
* Karmun (NPM)
  * Shows how other people are creating things using javascript. 
  * In a way if doing coding, there are many ways to achieve one thing. 
  * See how other people are doing things.

* Charles
  * Javascript best programming language
  * Widely used 
  * NPM is node package manager. 

* Pung
  * Coding is a continous improvement
  * NPM packages are other people's code that others can see and view the soruce code. 
  * Can see other better ways to solve a particular problem
  * Copying other people's work is a good thing as you can learn off each other (contratry to traditional schooling)

* Weining
  * Understanding the logic of javascript is not easy but critical
  * You can use any package for your own purpose

* Weevian
  * Javascript most challenging part - to understand the logic and to read like a machine. 
  * Practice is important 
  * Most coders are using the fundamentals, but they have creative ways to put code together to do great thing. 
    * The way they solve the problem is innovative. It's the how of solving, not the act of solving itself. 

* Melissa
  * A whole new world
  * The most I learnt javascript, the less i know. 
    * I dont know what i dont know
  * Have to be detailed. It's a very specific language. cannot miss even a fullstop or a curly brace
  * Before writing code, need to know what you want. Plan out your code before actually doing the work. 
  * NPM is a package manager. allows people to contribute to other's people packages
  * Allows other people to use your work

* Erin
  * Can learn from other's people code
  * Javascript similar to other langauges due to the logical thinking that is required regardless of the language
  * Every language must be patient and determined to solve the problem
  * Understanding what code you are writing

# How does one learn effectively the art of coding
* Discussion with others - Melissa
* Hands On - Weevian 
* Focus - Erin
* Learning on your own. Learning to be independent. - Charles
* Teaching others is a way to practice - Melissa
* Be curious - Charles

# Notes from the coordinator
1) This week we solidfied our knowlege of javascript and the classes. We learnt about constructors and methods. 
2) We created mini classes of Ogres and Humans with methods of `attack` and `heal`. 
3) We learnt what it takes to build a mini program that contains state
4) Finally we moved to Vuejs where we build reactive dynamic websites that has use interractions.
