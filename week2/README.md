=======
This week was all about solidifying up our knowledge of javascript variables, conditionals and datastructures. 
We get to see for the first time how data is being stored, and what's the purpose of having data structures. 
We also learnt how to access data in objects and arrays, the 2 most important data structures being used in everyday programming. 

# Thoughts from the coordinator
Constant practice is important. We can see clearly some can move further ahead with more practice. Then by teaching others, only will they ever improve further. 
This is important for the learning efficiency of all the students. To grow and learn together

# What we learnt
* NPM Package manager
  * How to install libraries from others
  * How to read node_modules
  * Reading the code of other people (that's one very good way to learn)
* Javascript exports
  * exporting functions to be used by other functions
* Recursive Functions
  * How functions can return themselves


# Weekly challenge
* Download more NPM packages and read their codebase. Learn from how they write their code and learn how to use their functions
